# Project: üçîüëÅ Food Vision
In this project, we created a multi-class classification in which we used the already-provided 
**database of images from Tensorflow** (Food Vision) with all classes and tried to produce the results 
of the best **Computer Vision machines (77.4%)**.

## Feature extraction model
In the feature extraction model, we used transfer learning and took the best layer (EfficentNetB0) for the multi-classification model
