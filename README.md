# Project: 🍔👁 Food Vision
In this project, we will create a multi-class classification in which we will use the already-provided 
**database of images from Tensorflow** (Food Vision) with all classes and try to produce the results 
of the best **Computer Vision machines (77.4%)**.

## Feature extraction model
In the feature extraction model, we used transfer learning and took the best layer (EfficentNetB0) for the multi-classification model
